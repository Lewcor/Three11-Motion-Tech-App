The previous AI engineer successfully transformed THREE11 MOTION TECH into a comprehensive AI platform through six distinct phases, culminating in full implementation of Social Media Automation. Key recent accomplishments included integrating the Perplexity AI key, fixing environment variable loading in , and fully implementing a  with tabs. A crucial rebranding effort replaced trademarked AI model names (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude) with THREE11 branded alternatives for legal compliance. The engineer then developed and integrated Platform Presentation and User Guide components. Most recently, a robust authentication system with admin/team member roles and a special registration code was implemented. The engineer then tackled UI/UX issues, reorganizing the crowded top navigation into a clean, categorized vertical sidebar. The immediate challenge before this summary was a persistent user report that the custom domain  was serving an old, cached version of the application despite multiple troubleshooting attempts, which the  identified as a stale build artifact issue.

The AI THREE11 MOTION TECH - APP was initially an AI-powered caption and hashtag generator. The user's MASTER PLAN guided its evolution through six sequential phases into an Ultimate AI Platform:
1.  **Advanced AI Integration Hub:** Integrated Perplexity AI, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, with an AI Provider Selection Interface.
2.  **Power User Features:** Implemented Batch Content Generation, Content Scheduling, Advanced Analytics, and Content Templates.
3.  **Content Type Expansion:** Added Video/Podcast descriptions, Email Marketing, Blog Post, and Product Descriptions.
4.  **Intelligence & Insights:** Introduced Performance Tracking, Engagement Prediction, A/B Testing, Competitor Monitoring, and Trend Forecasting, utilizing new database collections.
5.  **Team Collaboration Platform:** Included Multi-User Accounts, Content Approval Workflows, Team Permissions, Collaboration Tools, and Brand Guidelines.
6.  **Social Media Automation:** Implemented Direct Social Posting, Cross-Platform Publishing, CRM Integration, Analytics Tools, and Calendar Integration.
Recent requirements included rebranding AI model names for trademark compliance, creating a comprehensive presentation and user guide, and developing an unlimited access login system for 1 admin and 10 team members with specific authentication methods (Email/Password + Google, self-registration with code, full admin access). The user then requested a redesign of the crowded horizontal navigation into a vertical sidebar.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer meticulously completed all six phases of the THREE11 MOTION TECH - ULTIMATE AI PLATFORM master plan, with particular focus on Phase 6 (Social Media Automation). The work then transitioned to enhancing the user experience and core functionalities.

**Perplexity AI Integration & Environment Variables:** The Perplexity AI API key was successfully integrated into the backend's  file. A critical bug preventing AI providers from showing as available was identified and fixed: the  call was moved directly into  to ensure environment variables are loaded before AI service instantiation. Backend testing confirmed this fix.

**User Documentation & Presentation:** A  component was created, integrated into navigation, and confirmed functional. Subsequently, a full  and  were developed, integrated into the navigation, and visually verified to be comprehensive and professional. Icon import issues (e.g., ) were resolved during this process.

**AI Provider Rebranding:** Following user concern about trademark infringement, all user-facing AI model names (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) were successfully rebranded to THREE11 branded names (e.g., THREE11 Pro AI, THREE11 Creative AI) across backend and frontend components, while maintaining original technical names for API calls.

**Enhanced Authentication System:** A comprehensive authentication system was implemented for unlimited access for the user and 10 team members. This included:
*   **Backend:** Enhanced  and  models, new  for registration, login, and user management, and new API endpoints in . The  library was integrated for password hashing, and a  was configured. An admin account ( with a temporary password ) and a team registration code () were initialized.
*   **Frontend:**  was enhanced to support new login/signup flows, display admin credentials, and allow team members to self-register with the special code.

**Navigation Redesign:** The previously crowded top navigation was completely redesigned. The AI engineer transformed it into a clean, categorized vertical sidebar navigation, accessed via a Menu button, with logical groupings like Core Features, Power Features, etc.

**Domain Access Issue:** The immediate work prior to this summary was troubleshooting a persistent issue where the user's custom domain () was not displaying the latest application changes, instead showing an old version. The AI engineer attempted various restarts and frontend rebuilds. The  was invoked and identified the root cause: the custom domain was serving from a stale build artifact. A new optimized production build was just completed, and the frontend service was restarted, aiming to resolve this specific domain display issue.

Verify that the  domain now displays the latest, correct application version.
