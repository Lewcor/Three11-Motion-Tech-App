The trajectory details a challenging debugging process centered on deploying the THREE11 MOTION TECH APP and resolving critical Network error and front page missing issues on the user's custom domain (). The core problem stemmed from the AI engineer working in an isolated environment, leading to fixes not propagating to the user's live Job ID (). Repeated attempts involved modifying , adjusting frontend routing (from  to  and back), and correcting  environment variable usage ( to ). Despite the AI engineer confirming fixes in a demo environment and providing manual steps, the user consistently reported unresolved issues, highlighting a persistent communication and deployment synchronization gap. The engineer attempted to push to GitHub but failed due to authentication.

<product_requirements>
The THREE11 MOTION TECH APP is envisioned as a Revolutionary AI-Powered Content Creation Platform. The application requires a clean UI with a top bar and a toggleable vertical sidebar categorizing over 30 features (Core, Power, Analytics, Content Studio, Team, Premium). Key branding elements like the logo, Revolutionary AI-Powered Content Creation Platform header, and a purple gradient are crucial. Core features include placeholder components for Caption Generator, Voice Studio, Trends Analyzer, and Content Remix. The platform needs a competitive pricing structure and support for 13 unlimited access codes for team members, with a functional Sign In button and authentication system. A significant feature is the AI Video Studio for text-to-video generation using Google's Imagen 3. The application must display and function correctly on mobile devices, with the full app interface loading by default, rather than just the landing page.

- The user continues to report that the front page (LandingPage) is not displayed correctly, even though the agent confirmed it's configured as the root route.
- The Network error during login persists for the user, preventing sign-in via the custom domain , despite the agent's confirmed fixes and working demo.
- The authentication process via Sign In and Get Started buttons is still not functional for the user.

<current_work>
The immediate focus has been on resolving persistent issues reported by the user regarding the THREE11 MOTION TECH application on their custom domain . The user consistently reports a Network error during login and the front page is not on there.

The AI engineer identified and attempted to fix several root causes:
1.  **Environment Mismatch**: The AI engineer initially worked in a different Job ID than the user's live deployment, rendering early fixes ineffective.
2.  **Incorrect **: The frontend's  file () had  pointing to incorrect preview domains or , leading to CORS issues and network errors. This was repeatedly updated to .
3.  **Frontend Routing**: The root path () in  was initially changed to  but later reverted to  based on user feedback.
4.  **AuthPage Environment Variable Usage**: The  component was found to be inconsistently using  and , which was corrected to exclusively use .
5.  **Double API Path**: An issue where API calls sometimes resulted in a double  prefix (e.g., ) was addressed in .

Despite the AI engineer applying these fixes in their environment, building production versions, restarting services, and even creating a working demo at , the user still reports the exact same issues on their live Job ID . The critical hurdle remains the synchronization of code changes between the agent's environment and the user's live deployment, as the agent cannot directly push to the user's live environment without proper GitHub authentication or directly access the user's Job ID for manual changes. The agent has provided manual change instructions multiple times, but the user is unable to apply them.

The next step is to assist the user in applying the provided fixed code to their Job ID  and ensure successful deployment and functionality.
