The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and progressed the development of the THREE11 MOTION TECH application, transitioning it from an MVP to a more comprehensive platform. The work followed a structured, phased approach, beginning with environment setup, codebase exploration, and a detailed master plan proposed to the user. The engineer meticulously implemented backend services, database schema updates, and frontend components for two major phases: Advanced AI Integration Hub (Phase 1) and Power User Features (Phase 2), with thorough testing at each stage. Currently, the engineer is actively working on Content Type Expansion (Phase 3), having completed all backend services and initiated frontend component creation and navigation integration. The communication was clear, with frequent user confirmations and requests for API keys when needed.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has meticulously progressed through the user's MASTER PLAN.
**Phase 1: Advanced AI Integration Hub** is fully complete and functional. This includes:
*   Backend integration of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Perplexity Sonar Pro (awaiting API key).
*   New API endpoints for AI provider information.
*   Frontend  component, allowing users to select AI models, view capabilities, and use presets.
*   Comprehensive backend and frontend testing confirmed all functionality.

**Phase 2: Power User Features** is also fully complete and functional. This includes:
*   Backend services and API endpoints for Batch Content Generation, Content Scheduling, Template Library, and Advanced Analytics Dashboard.
*   New database models () to support these features.
*   Frontend components (, , , ).
*   Integration of these components into both desktop and mobile navigation bars and application routing.
*   Backend and frontend testing verified full functionality.

**Phase 3: Content Type Expansion** is currently in progress.
*   All backend services and API endpoints for the new content types (Video Captions, Podcast Descriptions, Email Marketing, Blog Posts, Product Descriptions) have been implemented and tested (, , , ,  and corresponding  updates and  routing).
*   All required frontend components for these content types have been created (, , , , ).
*   The current state of work is integrating these newly created frontend components into the application's navigation system. The last action was editing the  to add missing imports, indicating this integration is ongoing.
