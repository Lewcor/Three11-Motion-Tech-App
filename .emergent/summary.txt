<current_work>
The previous AI engineer systematically completed Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, culminating in the full implementation and verification of Phase 6: Social Media Automation.

**Phase 5: Team Collaboration Platform** was fully implemented backend and frontend. Backend services (, ) and API endpoints were added and comprehensively tested. Frontend components (, , , ) were created, integrated into  and navigation bars, and visually verified via screenshots for full functionality, displaying mock data for team details, member management, role permissions, and collaboration threads.

**Phase 6: Social Media Automation** has been entirely implemented and confirmed to be fully functional.
*   **Backend:** New models were added to . Four new backend services were created: , , , and . API endpoints for these services were integrated into . Minor issues with service variable names and an extra colon in  were fixed. Backend was thoroughly tested and verified.
*   **Frontend:** New components were created: , , , and . These were integrated into , , and . A critical compilation error in  (due to a missing 'Sync' icon import) was identified and fixed by replacing it with . All Phase 6 frontend components were visually tested via screenshots, demonstrating full functionality including multi-platform dashboards, post publishing, automation workflows, and CRM integrations with mock data.

The application has been transformed into a comprehensive, enterprise-level social media automation platform. The last action taken was to create a new frontend component, , to serve as a user guide and presentation for the completed application. The engineer is currently in the process of integrating this new guide into the application's navigation and routing.
